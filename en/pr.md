These notes cover some topics for the 2024/25 microeconomics course at Bocconi.

They are designed to substitute the corresponding treatment given in the course's textbook (Bernheim & Whinston's "Microeconomics") in a way that blends as seamlessly as possible (in terms of notation, terminology, etc.) with the rest of that book.
